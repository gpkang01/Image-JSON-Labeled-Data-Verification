## Image-JSON-Labeled-Data-Verification

1. This program is the verification tool on labeled data of JSON format for A.I deep learning.
   It was worked as just first try due to no feedback.
2. Now you can check only the existance of JSON data and the shape of polygon.
3. Each image folder name in "images" folder is matched to each JSON file name in "json" folder.
   So please follows the current naming format.
